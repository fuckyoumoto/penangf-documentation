## What is PAKS?

Paks is a system application that comes in every motorola phone. It is a Mobile Device Management app (MDM), which serve the purpose mainly in IT and carrier locked device to verify the phone integrity and status.<br/><br/>
The app, being an admin of the device, has the possibility to completely disable the device if suspicious activity is detected (in the context it serves).<br/>
For example, for phones being payed by instalments, it can disable the device if the consumer stops paying.<br/>

Could also be another one of the Moto APPS that install bloatware.<br/>
Verification happens right after the device is first connected to the internet.

The only way to disable/remove PAKS is to root the device, something that it's still not possible.
