        **CLK**, **DAT0** and **CMD** usually are testpoints to access BROM.

        However, it seems like BROM is disabled by fuse, so shorting them to ground just makes the phone hang without any response until the short is removed.


        DON'T use these points if you don't know what you're doing.

## More testpoints?
Also, although we don't have testpoints for this, we still have the ability to access [KPCOL1](../schematic/keypad.md#kpcol1), [PWRKEY_SW](../schematic/control-if.md#pwrkey_sw), [HOMEKEY_SW](../schematic/control-if.md#homekey_sw).
